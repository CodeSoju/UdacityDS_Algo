Time Complexity of each task:

Task 0:
The T.C. of this task is O(1) since we are just retrieving data from the .csv file. 

Task 1:
The T.C. is O(n) with n being length of the text and call lists. The loops both go from 0 to n. 

Task 2:
The T.C. is O(n) with n being the length of the calls list. The for-loop will iterate from 0 to n. The conditionals will hold no 
significant difference to the T.C..

Task 3: 
The two functions have a T.C. of 0(1) since they are just conditionals. The for-loop which is calculating whether the number is from Bangalore is checking from the length of calls list which we will say is n. So the T.C. is O(n).

Task 4: 
The T.C. of T4 is O(k) since we are iterating through the call and text list. Those lists have their respective lengths, say m and n. 
The overall T.C. of these loops would be O(m+n) which for the sake of this analysis we say is equal to k. So O(m+n) = O(k)
